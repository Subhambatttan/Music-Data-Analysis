FROM CUSTOMER AS CUS
JOIN INVOICE AS INV ON CUS.CUSTOMER_ID = INV.CUSTOMER_ID
JOIN INVOICE_LINE AS INVL ON INV.INVOICE_ID = INVL.INVOICE_ID
WHERE INVL.TRACK_ID IN(
 SELECT T.TRACK_ID
 FROM TRACK AS T
 JOIN GENRE AS G ON T.GENRE_ID = G.GENRE_ID
 WHERE G.NAME LIKE 'Rock'
)
ORDER BY CUS.EMAIL;
```

Q2. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. 
- Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.

			PARTITION BY CU.COUNTRY ORDER BY COUNT(IL.QUANTITY) DESC
		) AS ROW_NUM
	FROM CUSTOMER AS CU
	JOIN INVOICE AS IV ON CU.CUSTOMER_ID = IV.CUSTOMER_ID
	JOIN INVOICE_LINE AS IL ON IV.INVOICE_ID = IL.INVOICE_ID
	JOIN TRACK AS TR ON IL.TRACK_ID = TR.TRACK_ID
	JOIN GENRE AS GE ON TR.GENRE_ID = GE.GENRE_ID
	GROUP BY CU.COUNTRY, GE.NAME, GE.GENRE_ID
	ORDER BY CU.COUNTRY, TOTAL_PURCHASES DESC
)
SELECT COUNTRY, TOP_GENRE, TOTAL_PURCHASES
FROM POPULAR_GENRE WHERE ROW_NUM = 1;
```

Q3. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country. 
- Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent.

			PARTITION BY CU.COUNTRY ORDER BY SUM(IV.TOTAL) DESC
		) AS ROW_NUM
	FROM INVOICE AS IV
	JOIN CUSTOMER AS CU ON IV.CUSTOMER_ID = CU.CUSTOMER_ID
	GROUP BY CU.COUNTRY, CU.CUSTOMER_ID, CU.FIRST_NAME, CU.LAST_NAME
	ORDER BY CU.COUNTRY, AMOUNT_SPENT DESC
)
SELECT COUNTRY, CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AMOUNT_SPENT
